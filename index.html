				<li>1 ¼ cups all-purpose flour(155 g)</li>

          <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <ol>		  
				<li>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.
				<li>Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.</li>
				<li>Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).</li>
				<li>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.</li>
				<li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
				<li>Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.</li>
				<li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.</li>
				<li>Cool completely before serving.</li>
				<li>Enjoy!</li>
